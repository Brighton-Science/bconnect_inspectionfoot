# The BC Mobile & Surface Analyst Custom Inspection Attachment


## INTRODUCTION:
This readme is intended to help the end user successfully design and fabricate their own custom foot known as a CIA(Custom Inspection Attachment).


## DESCRIPTION:
The standard attachment works very well mating to a flat surface. It does not facilitate the ability to measure on surfaces that have more complex features or geometry. 

3D printing technology allows a mechanical designer to create a CIA in house to quickly adapt the Surface Analyst to their particular substrate(s).  Although many additive manufactoring techiques are available the primary design intent for the information provided is for FDM printing using black material.


## USAGE:
Using both .pdf files of the “Tethered Universal head template” and “Tethered Universal CIA template” blueprints, design and fabrication of a CIA is made easier. Critical dimensions and noted drop placement will assist in helping construct a CIA that successfully allows the technician the ability to land a drop properly and gather contact angle readings. Both .pdf files will also provide the dimensional information required to use the 1/4-20 mounting features on the side of the measurement head.

Using the .stp files of both the “Tethered Universal head template” and “Tethered Universal CIA template” will allow the CAD designer to interface with the architecture directly.  Material can be added or removed to allow the designer to make proper engagement with the mating geometry.
